Your service is protected with a secret, to prevent malicious access. 
This applies to GraphQL operations, as well as sending an introspection query (which happens when opening the URL in the Playground).

The secret can be found in prisma.yml, it is actually one string that is a comma separated list of secrets, to allow for secret rotation without downtime.

You can generate a token that is signed with a secret using the 'prisma token' command.

Then, set your query headers to this:

{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
}
